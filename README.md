## Breast Cancer Types Prediction

Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers among women globally, accounting for approximately 25% of all cancer cases. In 2015 alone, over 2.1 million people were affected. Early and accurate detection of breast cancer is critical to improve treatment outcomes and survival rates. 

This project focuses on developing a **machine learning model** to classify breast tumors as **malignant (cancerous)** or **benign (non-cancerous)** based on a dataset containing various clinical features of breast tumors. 

### Key Highlights:
- Utilizes supervised learning techniques to build and evaluate predictive models.
- Analyzes features related to tumor characteristics to determine their impact on diagnosis.
- Addresses challenges of feature selection, multicollinearity, and model interpretability.

### Dataset Description:
The dataset contains records of breast tumor diagnoses, labeled as:
- **M (Malignant)**: Cancerous tumors.
- **B (Benign)**: Non-cancerous tumors.

Each record includes several numerical features derived from image analysis of the tumors. These features represent important diagnostic measurements.

### Objectives:
1. Preprocess and explore the dataset to identify patterns and relationships.
2. Apply various machine learning models to classify tumors.
3. Evaluate the models using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Provide insights into the most significant features contributing to the classification.
